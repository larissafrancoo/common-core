Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night
And everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window
And a blue Corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen

I'm blue
Da ba dee, dabba da-ee
I'm blue
Da ba dee, dabba da-ee
