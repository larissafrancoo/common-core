Hey, brother
There’s an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do

Hey, brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do

Oh, oh, oh

What if I'm far from home?
What if I lose it all?
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do
